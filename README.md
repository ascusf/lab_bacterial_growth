# Bacterial-Growth # University of South Florida laboratories - Bacterial Growth Simulation ## Overview   This project contains a script for simulating bacterial growth using various parameters for volume, time, and cell information. It includes functionality to plot growth curves and validate inputs to ensure they are within acceptable ranges.The bacterial_growth.py is a comprehensive bacterial growth simulation tool designed to model and analyze the growth of bacterial cultures, specifically using E. coli. The script includes classes to manage volume, time, and cell information, and handles plotting and calculations related to bacterial growth. The call_bacterial_growth.py simulates bacterial growth using either predefined data or user input. It calculates and plots bacterial concentration and population size over time, with options for inputting experimental parameters directly or using provided data sets. The ecoli_data.py collected data that can be call into scripts to analyze.Iâ€™m currently in the early stages of programming, and I have a lot of work ahead. My goal is to become familiar with Python and GitHub.  ## stand alone Functions (working on)- **average_initial_od:** Calculate the average initial optical density (OD) from the provided data. - **calculate_lagged:** need Code- **linear_growth:** Estimates the linear growth of bacterial culture based on OD600 measurements.- **poly3_growth:** Estimates the polynomial degree of 3 growth of bacterial culture based on OD600 measurements.- **calculate_stationary_od:** Calculate the average steady OD from the provided data.## Features - **Volume Information:** Manage and validate volume-related parameters. - **Time Information:** Manage and validate time-related parameters. - **Cell Information:** Manage and validate cell-related parameters. - **Plotting:** Visualize bacterial growth simulation results with plotting functionality. - **GrowthConfiguration:** Manage all configuration information for bacterial growth simulation.- **Validation:** Ensure inputs are valid and handle errors gracefully. - **Simulation:** Perform bacterial growth simulation and analyze results. ## Installation To use this script, you need to have Python 3, packages numpy and pylab installed and imports:  - import copy, math  - from pylab import plot,xlabel,ylabel,yscale,grid,title,show,figure,subplot,legend,xticks- from numpy import mean,array,arange,zeros,argmax,exp,poly1d,polyfit,diff,log,std- from scipy.stats import linregress- from ecoli_data import *You can install pylab, numpy, and scipy packages using pip: ## Define volume information volume_info = VolumeInformation(total_volume=25, sample_volume=200, dilute_volume=1800) # Functionsinit(self, total_volume, sample_volume, dilute_volume): Initializes the volume parameters.get_total_volume(self): Returns the total volume of the sample.get_sample_volume(self): Returns the volume of the sample.get_dilute_volume(self): Returns the volume of the diluent.  ## Define time information time_info = TimeInformation(lagged_time=2*60, target_time=60*7, double_time=60*2.5, final_time=60*10) # Functionsinit(self, lagged_time, target_time, double_time, final_time): Initializes the time parameters.get_lagged_time(self): Returns the lagged time.get_target_time(self): Returns the target time.get_double_time(self): Returns the doubling time.get_final_time(self): Returns the final simulation time.  ## Define cell information cell_info = CellInformation(cell_mass=47.65e-6, cell_per_volume=1E7) # Functionsinit(self, cell_mass, cell_per_volume): Initializes the cell parameters.get_cell_mass(self): Returns the mass of a single bacterial cell.get_cell_per_volume(self): Returns the number of cells per mL when saturated.  ## Define Plot -
