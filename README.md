# Bacterial-Growth 
# laboratories - Bacterial Growth Simulation 

## Overview 
  
This project contains a script for simulating bacterial growth using various parameters for volume, time, and cell information. It includes functionality to plot growth curves and validate inputs to ensure they are within acceptable ranges.

The bacterial_growth.py is a comprehensive bacterial growth simulation tool designed to model and analyze the growth of bacterial cultures, specifically using E. coli. The script includes classes to manage volume, time, and cell information, and handles plotting and calculations related to bacterial growth.
 
The call_bacterial_growth.py simulates bacterial growth using either predefined data or user input. It calculates and plots bacterial concentration and population size over time, with options for inputting experimental parameters directly or using provided data sets. 

The ecoli_data.py collected data that can be call into scripts to analyze.

Iâ€™m currently in the early stages of programming, and I have a lot of work ahead. My goal is to become familiar with Python and GitHub.

# Run the bacterial growth simulation and plots
- with collected data use calculated_double_time function in class Plot.
- The code calculates the slopes between each point, finds the index of the maximum slope and uses linear equation to estimate the doubling time.
cal_double_time = Plot(data=test,initial_read=initial_read).calculate_double_time()

                        dilute_volume=1800)

The script includes error handling to manage issues that may arise during execution, such as invalid input values. This ensures that the simulation runs smoothly and provides informative error messages when issues occur. 

# Inputs:

# Calculations:

The average data is calculated and plotted.

The calculation accounts for the lagged time and exponential growth of bacteria restricted by the original total volume.

rate: Growth rate in 1/minute

max_od: Maximum concentration in micrograms/mL

1 OD600 = saturation
