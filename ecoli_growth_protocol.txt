Collecting Data for Bacterial Growth Curve – E. coliMaterials	LB broth with carbenicillin	E. coli culture (referred to as sample)	LB broth (referred to as dilute)	12 mL Tubes	37°C incubator	37°C shaker	Refrigerator 4°C	Eppendorf Biospectrometer kinetic (for OD600 measurements)	1.5 mL Cuvettes  	LB agar plates	pH paper	biowaste container	Pipette and tips	Ice for cuvettes	StopwatchProcedureLabeling:	Label #N tubes as #hot and #N tubes as #cold. Where N equals the amount of cuvettes	Label one tube as 1. This is the original tube.	Label one tube as 2. This the tube we are cooling to 4°C Preparation:	Spread the sample on an LB agar plate and place it in a 37°C incubator overnight.	Pick one colony-forming unit (CFU) from the plate.Initial Culture Growth:	Transfer the CFU into an 8 mL tube labeled #1 and place it in a 37°C shaker for 2 hours.	Transfer 10 mL of the culture into another tube labeled #2 and place it in the refrigerator to cool to 4°C (this should take approximately 10 minutes).OD600 Measurements – Eppendorf BioSpectrometer kinetics:	Take the OD600 of tube #1 and recorded.	After tube #2 cools to 4°C, take the OD600 and recorded.Dilution to OD600 = 0.5 μg/mL or .05 abs: 	Calculate the volumes needed to achieve an OD600 of 0.5 μg/mL for both #hot and #cold tubes.	Example Calculation:	Given:	OD600, original = 4 μg/mL	OD600, dilute = 0.5 μg/mL	V_total = V_sample + V_sample  = 4 mL	Dilution factor = (V_sample + V_dilute) / V_sample	OD600, dilute = OD600, original / Dilution factor	Solving for V_sample:	V_sample = (OD600, dilute / OD600, original) * V_total	V_sample = (0.5 / 4) * 4 = 0.5 mL	V_dilute = V_total - V_sample = 4 - 0.5 = 3.5 mLTransfer and Mix:	Transfer the calculated volumes (e.g., 3.5 mL of LB and 0.5 mL of the sample) into the #hot tubes from tube #1 and the #cold tubes from tube #2.Time-course OD600 Measurements:	record OD600 measurements from the #hot and #cold tubes every 60 minutes or suitable intervals.	Compare OD600 and microgram/mL. Notes:	Ensure the tube caps are loosely on to allow for gas exchange.	Collect N=3 data points for each OD600 measurement to ensure accuracy and reproducibility.	Eppendorf Biospectrometer kinetic units: μg/mL and abs.	OD600 input volumes are 200 μL sample and 1800 μL dilute.	One cuvette will have the LB 2000 μL to blank the machine.	Check OD settings, cuvettes size, sample and dilute volumes, wavelength, units	Reuse cuvettes after pouring them in a biowaste container.	Ensure cuvettes are clean to avoid cross-contamination and measurement errors.	Put cuvettes on ice will stop e. coli from growing. 	Error could be due to Reused cuvettes	Should check pH.	OD600 range 0.05 to 1.0 where 1.0 is saturation.	OD stands for optical density, a measure of how much a substance absorbs light.	Cuvette pathway is 10 mm using 2 mm pathway at high OD is better. 	E.coli doubles roughly at 4 micrograms/mL or 0.4 abs, and may saturate at higher concentrations in low volumes.
