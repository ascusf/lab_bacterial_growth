Collecting Data for Bacterial Growth Curve – E. coli 

Materials 

LB broth with carbenicillin 

E. coli culture (referred to as sample) 

LB broth (referred to as dilute) 

12 mL Tubes 

250 mL flask 

37°C incubator 

37°C shaker 

Refrigerator 4°C 

Eppendorf Biospectrometer kinetic (for OD600 measurements) 

1.5 mL Cuvettes   

LB agar plates 

pH paper 

biowaste container 

Pipette and tips 

Stopwatch 

Procedure 

Labeling: 

Label #N tubes as #hot and #N tubes as #cold. Where N equals the amount of cuvettes 

Label one tube as 1. This is the original tube. 

Label one tube as 2. This the tube we are cooling to 4°C  

Preparation: 

Spread the sample on an LB agar plate and place it in a 37°C incubator overnight. 

Pick one colony-forming unit (CFU) from the plate. 

Initial Culture Growth: 

Transfer the CFU into a 12 mL tube labeled #1 and place it in a 37°C shaker for 2 hours.  

Transfer half of the volume of #1 tube into another tube labeled #2 and place it in the refrigerator to cool to 4°C (this should take approximately 10 minutes). 

OD600 Measurements – Eppendorf BioSpectrometer kinetics: 

Take the OD600 of tube #1 and recorded. 

After tube #2 cools to 4°C, take the OD600 and recorded. 

Dilution to OD600 = 0.5 μg/mL or .05 abs:  

Calculate the volumes needed to achieve an OD600 of 0.5 μg/mL for both #hot and #cold tubes. 

Example Calculation: 

Given: 

OD600, original = 4 μg/mL 

OD600, dilute = 0.5 μg/mL 

V_total = V_sample + V_sample  = 4 mL 

Dilution factor = (V_sample + V_dilute) / V_sample 

OD600, dilute = OD600, original / Dilution factor 

Solving for V_sample: 

V_sample = (OD600, dilute / OD600, original) * V_total 

V_sample = (0.5 / 4) * 4 = 0.5 mL 

V_dilute = V_total - V_sample = 4 - 0.5 = 3.5 mL 

Transfer and Mix: 

Transfer the calculated volumes (e.g., 3.5 mL of LB and 0.5 mL of the sample) into the #hot tubes from tube #1 and the #cold tubes from tube #2. 

Time-course OD600 Measurements: 

record OD600 measurements from the #hot and #cold tubes every 60 minutes or suitable intervals. Be sure to use ice and be quick to stop bacterial growth! 

Compare OD600 and microgram/mL. 

Shape 

Notes: 

Ensure the tube caps are loosely on to allow for gas exchange. 

Collect N=3 data points for each OD600 measurement to ensure accuracy and reproducibility. 

Eppendorf Biospectrometer kinetic units: μg/mL and abs. 

OD600 input volumes are 200 𝜇L sample and 1800 𝜇L dilute or 10% sample the total volume.  

One cuvette will have the LB 2000 𝜇L to blank the machine. 

Check OD settings, cuvettes size, sample and dilute volumes, wavelength, units 

Reuse cuvettes after pouring them in a biowaste container. 

Ensure cuvettes are clean to avoid cross-contamination and measurement errors. 

Put cuvettes on ice will stop e. coli from growing, but condensation might form causing high OD.  

Error could be due to Reused cuvettes 

Should check pH. 

OD600 range 0.05 to 1.0 where 1.0 is saturation. 

OD stands for optical density, a measure of how much a substance absorbs light. 

Cuvette pathway is 10 mm using 2 mm pathway at high OD is better.  

May saturate at higher concentrations in low volumes. 

12 mL Tubes can be filled up to 8 mL with the cap loosen or liquid will spill.  

flask aeration is better
